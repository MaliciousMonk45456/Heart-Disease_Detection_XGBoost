# Heart-Disease_Detection_XGBoost
Detecting the presence of heart disease using XGBoost and showing implementation of decision tree using custom functions

Data pre-processing using label-encoding and one-hot-encoding and showing implementation of basic decision tree functions for splitting at a node and information gain

Using XGBoost to create a ensemble of decision trees to predict the presence of a heart disease and optimising it using the accuracy score on the validation set to balance the trade off between bias and variance or underfitting and overfitting and set parameters such as the max depth of each decision tree and the number of decision trees in the random forest and then obtaining the accuracy on test set
